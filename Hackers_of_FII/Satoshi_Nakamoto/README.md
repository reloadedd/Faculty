# Custom Discord Bot

Custom-made Discord bot which has the following functionality:
- Create predefined roles
- Delete all roles created previously
- Assign a role to the user requesting that role

**Note:** Alongside with the bot, a HTTP server is spawned which 
is used to keep the bot running indefinitely, by pinging the 
address of that HTTP server.
