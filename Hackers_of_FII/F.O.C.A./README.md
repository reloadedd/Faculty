# Custom Discord Bot - F.O.C.A.

Custom-made Discord bot which has the following functionality:
- Create predefined colored roles, with specific permissions
- Delete all roles created previously
- Assign a role to the user requesting that role - the user will have to choose
the desired role from a drop-down menu
- Welcome new members
- Respond unasked in the chat when some keywords are mentioned
- Send embedded messages - styled, custom messages
- Say something when it joins a new guild
- Create private channels to which users can join & leave as they please
- It's also a DJ - it plays music by searching for keywords on YouTube, or
directly using links to YouTube, SoundCloud and maybe more (did not try 
something else, honestly)

**Note:** Alongside with the bot, an HTTP server is spawned which 
is used to keep the bot running indefinitely, by pinging the 
address of that HTTP server.
